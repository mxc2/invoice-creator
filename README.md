# Invoice-Creator

### Description
This React application was created using React JavaScript for SmartAccount's Full Stack Web Developer application. It serves as an invoice generator, allowing users to input client information, invoice dates, and multiple line items. The application dynamically calculates the total based on the entered item quantities and prices. Additionally, users can easily remove unnecessary line items.

This project solely focuses on frontend development. For a more comprehensive view of my capabilities, I suggest checking out the [Product Management Site](https://github.com/mxc2/product-management-site) project. It not only utilizes React for frontend functionality but also incorporates an intriguing PHP-based backend.
